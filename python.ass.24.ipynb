    "The relationship between def statements and lambda expressions is that they both define functions in Python, but they have different syntax and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A def statement is used to define a named function in Python. It consists of the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for the function parameters, a colon, and a block of code that defines the function's behavior. The defined function can be called later by its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a lambda expression is used to create anonymous functions in Python. It provides a way to define small, one-line functions without a formal function definition. The lambda expression consists of the lambda keyword, followed by the parameters (if any), a colon, and an expression that is evaluated and returned as the result of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "square = lambda x: x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The key differences between def statements and lambda expressions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming: def statements create named functions that can be referenced by their name, while lambda expressions create anonymous functions without a name. However, lambda expressions can be assigned to variables to create callable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: def statements can include multiple lines of code and complex logic within the function block, while lambda expressions are limited to a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: def statements are commonly used for defining functions with reusable and more complex logic, whereas lambda expressions are useful for creating small, simple functions inline, often used as arguments in higher-order functions like map(), filter(), or sort()."

    "he lambda function in Python offers several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concise syntax: Lambda functions provide a compact syntax for defining small, anonymous functions in a single line of code. This makes the code more concise and easier to read, especially when the function logic is simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inline function definition: Lambda functions can be defined inline within other function calls or expressions, eliminating the need to define a separate named function. This is particularly useful when passing a function as an argument to another function, such as in higher-order functions like map(), filter(), or sort().\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding unnecessary function definition: Lambda functions are handy when a function is required for a short-lived, one-time use and defining a separate named function would be unnecessary and add overhead. Lambda functions allow you to define and use the function directly at the point of need without cluttering the code with additional function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function expressions: Lambda functions are expressions that can be assigned to variables or used within other expressions, allowing for more flexibility in function composition and dynamic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability in certain contexts: In some cases, using a lambda function can improve code readability by keeping the function logic close to its usage, especially when the function is simple and the intent is clear."

    "map(function, sequence): The map function applies the specified function to each element in the sequence and returns an iterator containing the results. It takes each element from the sequence, passes it as an argument to the function, and collects the output into a new iterable.

    "Recursive functions are functions that call themselves, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. In a recursive function, the function body includes a base case that specifies the condition under which the function stops calling itself, and a recursive case that defines how the function calls itself with a smaller or simpler input.\n",

    "When it comes to coding functions, there are several general design guidelines that can help improve readability, maintainability, and reusability of your code. Here are some of the key guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Naming: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for your functions that accurately convey their purpose and functionality. Follow a consistent naming convention, such as using lowercase letters and underscores (snake_case) in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Length: Keep your functions concise and focused on a single task. Avoid writing excessively long functions that try to do too much. If a function becomes too long, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Parameters: Choose function parameters carefully and avoid excessive use of global variables. Use parameters to pass necessary inputs to the function and make it more modular. Aim for functions that are self-contained and don't rely on external variables unless necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Return Values: Clearly define what the function should return. Make sure the return value(s) accurately represent the result or output of the function. If a function performs a side effect without returning any value, consider documenting it clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Readability: Write clean and readable code by following consistent indentation, using meaningful variable names, adding appropriate comments, and applying consistent formatting. Use whitespace and line breaks effectively to improve readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation for your functions. Use docstrings to describe the purpose, parameters, and return value(s) of the function. Good documentation helps other developers (including yourself) understand how to use and interact with your functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Aim for reusable functions that can be used in different contexts. Avoid duplicating code by extracting common functionality into separate functions. Modular and reusable functions are easier to maintain and can save development time in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling: Handle potential errors and exceptions gracefully within your functions. Use appropriate error handling techniques like try-except blocks to handle exceptions and communicate errors effectively to the caller or user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit Testing: Write unit tests for your functions to verify their correctness and ensure they behave as expected. Test boundary cases, edge cases, and different scenarios to cover a wide range of input possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: Follow consistent coding conventions and style guidelines throughout your codebase. Consistency in naming, formatting, and code organization makes it easier for others to understand and collaborate on your code."

    "Functions can communicate results to a caller through various mechanisms. Here are three common ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Return Values: Functions can use the return statement to send back a result to the caller. The return value can be a single value, a tuple, a list, or any other data type. The caller can capture and use the returned value as needed.\n",

    "result = add(2, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying Mutable Objects: Functions can modify mutable objects passed as arguments, such as lists or dictionaries. Any modifications made to the object within the function will be visible to the caller as well.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "def append_item(lst, item):\n",

    "\n",
    "Global Variables: Although not recommended in most cases, functions can modify global variables to communicate results. However, this approach should be used sparingly and with caution, as it can make code less modular and harder to maintain.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "count = 0\n",
